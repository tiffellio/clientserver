//Separates the command and its argument calling 'parseCommandLine()' function.
//Determines, which valid command (FTP request) has been sent, only the commands defined in this header file are valid for this FTP server.
//Calls appropriate 'handleCommandXXXX()' function to handle a valid command.
//Calls 'handleCommandUnSupported()' if an invalid command has been received.


void parseCommandLine(char* commandLine, char* command, char* argument);
//Breaks the command line string that has been received through the first argument 'commandLine' into its parts 'command' and 'argument'.
//Assigns command part to reference parameter 'command' and argument part to reference parameter 'argument'.
//Caller retrieves the parts through the references ('command' and 'argument').


void handleCommandUSER(char* username, int& controlSockDescriptor, int& dataListenerSockDescriptor, int& dataSockDescriptor, bool& isClientConnected, bool& isUser);
//Handles USER command by comparing 'username' with the DEFAULT_USERNAME.
//If the 'username' matches, sets 'true' to 'isUser' and sends appropriate response to the client.
//If the 'username' does not match, sends appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'closeAllConnections()' function from 'ftp_server.connection.hpp'.
//Calls 'sendToRemote()' function from 'ftp_server_connection.hpp' to send a response to the client.

void handleCommandPASS(char* password, int& controlSockDescriptor, int& dataListenerSockDescriptor, int& dataSockDescriptor, bool& isClientConnected, bool& isUser, bool& isLoggedIn);
//Handles PASS command by comparing 'password' with the DEFAULT_PASSWORD.
//It also checks whether USER command was successful or not before this PASS command by checking the value in 'isUser'.
//A 'false' value in 'isUser' means USER command has not been successful before this PASS command.
//If there was no successful USER command, sends an appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the password does not match, sends appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling ''handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the password matches, sets 'true' to 'isLoogedIn' and sends appropriate response to the client.
//Calls 'sendToRemote()' function from 'ftp_server_connection.hpp' to send a response to the client.

void handleCommandPWD(int& controlSockDescriptor, int& dataListenerSockDescriptor, int& dataSockDescriptor, bool& isClientConnected, bool& isLoggedIn);
//Handles PWD command.
//First, checks whether the client is logged in or not by checking the value in 'isLoggedIn'.
//If the client is not logged in, sends an appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the client is logged in, determines the current working directory sends it to the client in an appropriate response.
//Calls 'sendToRemote()' function from 'ftp_server_connection.hpp' to send a response to the client.

void handleCommandCWD(char* directory, int& controlSockDescriptor, int& dataListenerSockDescriptor, int& dataSockDescriptor, bool& isClientConnected, bool& isLoggedIn);
//Handles CWD command.
//First, checks whether the client is logged in or not by checking the value in 'isLoggedIn'.
//If the client is not logged in, sends an appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the client is logged in, determines whether the requested 'directory' is valid or not.
//A requested directory is valid only if it is a sub directory of the current working directory.
//If the requested directory is not a valid directory, sends an appropriate response to the client.
//If the requested directory is valid, changes the current directory to the requested directory and sends an appropriate response to the client.
//Calls 'sendToRemote()' function from 'ftp_server_connection.hpp' to send a response to the client.

void handleCommandCDUP(int& controlSockDescriptor, int& dataListenerSockDescriptor, int& dataSockDescriptor, bool& isClientConnected, bool& isLoggedIn, const char* rootDir);
//Handles CDUP command.
//First, checks whether the client is logged in or not by checking the value in 'isLoggedIn'.
//If the client is not logged in, sends an appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the client is logged in, determines whether moving up to the parent directory is not falling beyond the project's root directory.
//Project's root directory is passed in the last parameter 'rootDir'.
//If the move does not go beyond project's root directory, changes the current working directory to the parent directory and sends an appropriate response to the client.
//If the the move goes beyond project's root directory, sends an appropriate response to the client.
//Calls 'sendToRemote()' function from 'ftp_server_connection.hpp' to send a response to the client.

void handleCommandPASV(char* argument, int& controlSockDescriptor, int& dataListenerSockDescriptor, int& dataSockDescriptor, bool& isClientConnected, bool& isLoggedIn);
//Handles PASV command.
//First, checks whether the client is logged in or not by checking the value in 'isLoggedIn'.
//If the client is not logged in, sends an appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the client is logged in, enters into passive mode by calling 'enteringIntoPassive()' function from 'ftp_server_passive.hpp'
//'enteringIntoPassive()' function starts a passive connection listener, sends an appropriate response to the client.
//'enteringIntoPassive()' function waits for a specific time interval for the client to send a connection request on the listener.
//'enteringIntoPassive()' function accepts client's connection request, if there is any, and opens a data connection with the client.
//'enteringIntoPassive()' function closes the connection listener after opening the data connection with the client.
//'enteringIntoPassive()' function also sends appropriate response to the client using control connection.

void handleCommandNLST(int& controlSockDescriptor, int& dataListenerSockDescriptor, int& dataSockDescriptor, bool& isClientConnected, bool& isLoggedIn);
//Handles NLST command.
//First, checks whether the client is logged in or not by checking the value in 'isLoggedIn'.
//If the client is not logged in, sends an appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the client is logged in, it checks whether the data connection has already been established by a PASV command before this NLST command.
//If a data connection has already been established 'dataSockDescriptor' parameter should have a non-negative value.
//If a data connection has not been established, sends an appropriate response to the user.
//If a data connection has already been established, prepares and sends the list of current directory entries by calling 'listDirEntries()' function
//from 'ftp_server_nlist.hpp'. 'listDirEntries()' function sends the list of current directory entries using the data connection
//and returns the count of entries.
//Sends the count of entries in an appropriate response message to the client using the control connection.
//Closes the data connection.  
//Calls 'sendToRemote()' function from 'ftp_server_connection.hpp' to send a response to the client.

//If the client is not logged in, sends an appropriate response to the client and closes all connections by calling 'handleNotLoggedIn()' function.
//If the client is logged in, it checks whether the data connection has already been established by a PASV command before this RETR command.
//If a data connection has already been established 'dataSockDescriptor' parameter should have a non-negative value.
//If a data connection has not been established, sends an appropriate response to the user.
//If a data connection has already been established, reads from the file and sends the content of the file by calling 'sendFile()' function
//from 'ftp_server_retrieve.hpp'. 'sendFile()' function sends the content of the file using the data connection
//and returns the count of the bytes sent.
//Sends the count of the bytes sent in an appropriate response message to the client using the control connection.
//Closes the data connection.  
//Calls 'sendToRemote()' function from 'ftp_server_connection.hpp' to send a response to the client.

//Sends an appropriate response saying the requested command is not supported by this FTP server.
